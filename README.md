### Original Goal
<p>This app was designed to add and delete music to a database. Users can also favorite a song, rate a song, and remove a song from favorites list.</p>

### Technologies Used:
1. React - Frontend
2. Node - Backend
3. Mongo - Database
4. JSX
5. CSS

### Approach Taken
<p>Our goal with this app was to design an interface for users to access a database of music and be able to favorite songs of their choosing. They then can access their favorite songs and rate them accordingly</p>

### Potential Future Plans
<p> Replace our manually built database with a fully functional third party API so we have access to much more music</p>

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Create a free [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) database online or start a local MongoDB database.
3. Create a `server/.env` file with a `MONGO_URL` property set to your MongoDB connection string.
4. In the terminal, run: `npm install` and `npm install` on the Backend

## Running the Project

1. In the terminal, run: `npm start` on the Frontend and `npm start` on the Backend
2. Browse to the frontend at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the backend at [localhost:3003/songs](http://localhost:3003/songs).
