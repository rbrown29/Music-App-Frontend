### Original Goal
<p>This app was designed to add and delete music to a database. Users can also favorite a song, rate a song, and remove a song from favorites list.</p>

### Technologies Used:
1. React - Frontend
2. Node - Backend
3. Mongo - Database
4. JSX
5. CSS

### Approach Taken
<p>Our goal with this app was to design an interface for users to access a database of music and be able to favorite songs of their choosing. They then can access their favorite songs and rate them accordingly</p>

### Potential Future Plans
<p> Replace our manually built database with a fully functional third party API so we have access to much more music</p>
